               <h2>PROBLEM:</h2>
               <p> Exercise and social stimulation are an essential part of a healthy life, not only for humans, but for our canine companions. Finding a safe, fun, and appropriate space for activity can be difficult for owners depending on their dog’s unique personality and various living situations.
</p>
             </div>
             <div>
               <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
               <p> A dedicated mobile product can equip dog owners with knowledge of dog-friendly spaces in any town or city, and allow them to make confident and informed decisions about where to bring their furry friend for needed activity.

               <h3>User Survey</h3>
               <p>I deployed a web-based survey on various social media platforms such as Instagram and Slack, in order to gauge various opinions and pain points for pet owners who rate themselves as people who consider their dog’s wellness a high priority.
               </p>

               <p>Of the options given, proximity, grass or terrain, and an enclosing fence were the most important factors for users when deciding on a dog park.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="process">
             <h3>Personas</h3>
               <p>Using the data gathered from the survey, I compiled some user personas in order to better ideate a design that will be useful and desirable to the project’s target audience.
</p>
                <div class="figure">

              <div class="process">
                <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
                <p>I then drafted user journey maps for the personas I had created. I imagined the thoughts and emotions the personas would be feeling throughout the process of going to the dog park prior to the use of Pupspot, and highlighted some reported pain points and how they might fit into the journey.

                  <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                   <p>Next came an analysis on some of the more prominent apps on the market with similar positioning and features. I needed to evaluate what potential competitors were doing right and wrong, why they had done it that way, and how they executed their design decisions. A SWOT exploration served as a key way to quickly break down the competition.

                    <h3>Sitemapping & Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>I distilled the user flows into a content outline and sitemap to get a feel for how many screens the product would require, how users will navigate across the product, and any gaps within the views.

                   <p>With this amount of architectural thinking complete, construction of screen layout could begin. Initial versions were quickly sketched out on paper, and higher fidelity wireframes were created and refined using Figma.

                   <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
                   <p>Developing a brand identity from scratch for the product involved several different processes that included asking myself questions about the product and its positioning, as well as studying successful brands that I found inspiring.
                   </p>

                   <p>There was a lot that I disliked about the branding of the product’s direct competitors, so I turned to pet-related brands outside of the sphere of dog park finders.
                   </p>

                   <p>I wanted the product to promise simplification, ease, and fun throughout an ongoing activity that can be stressful, confusing, and time-consuming. I made an effort to reflect this in the brand’s logo, typography, iconography, and color palette, all of which express a clean, minimal, and bold effect.

                   <div class="process">
                   <p>The product name is simple, and explains its own purpose, while being memorable, catchy, and undifficult to pronounce. The corresponding logo mark parallels the name in its simplicity and straightforward interpretation.
                    </p>

                    <p> The brand name also includes the tagline, “Where are you playing today?”
  The tagline supports the brand and encourages the user to to embrace the conviction of getting out with their dog and keeping exercise a priority. There is no question of “are you playing today,” as the tagline presents the user with the assumption that playing is a given.

              <p>Users were guided through multiple tasks and asked to report on the ease and logic of each task, as well as complete “I like, I wish, what if” sentences to add any additional insights they may have.

                   <p>
                     Additional development of the product could include many supplementary features, such as log-in functionality and the ability to save your favorite parks. The brand identity and positioning of the product could be utilized to gradually build a culture or trend that emphasizes the importance of dog owners’ prioritizing the exercise and stimulation that is crucial to the well-being of their pets, and allow a community of fun and stewardship to form, further strengthening the product’s use.
