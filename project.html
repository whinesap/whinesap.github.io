               <p>Potted is a cloud-based application that allows users to upload their plant collections and track care-related tasks such as watering and fertilizing, as well as receive care reminders.</p>

               <h2>PROBLEM:</h2>
               <p> Houseplants have moved beyond a trivial hobby, with consumers spending hundreds of dollars on a single specimen, or gathering collections of over 70 different varieties. This interest isn't exclusive to any gender, occupation, race, or style of living. Houseplants are now an investment and a statement, and organizing their care can become complicated and overwhelming.</p>
             </div>
             <div>
               <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
               <p> Potted seeks to make optimal plant care fun and accessible via a functional and minimalistic design. The user has the ability to add plants to their collection, view basic care tips, log tasks, and receive reminders. Users can additionally add friends, compile a plant wishlist, view friends' wishlists, and discover new plant varieties.</p>
             </div>
           </div>



           <!-- project process -->
           <div class="process">
               <h2>User Research</h2>
               <p>I began by sharing a survey on multiple social media platforms and forums in order to gauge interest in a plant-related application and collect information on current paid points.</p>
               <div class="figure">
                   <p> Interested in plants:<br>
                    100%</p>
                    <p>Interested in plant care:<br>
                    93.3%</p>
               </div>
               <p>Out of the 10 features given, saving a list of plants currently owned, water and fertilizer reminders, and timelines related to plant growth-periods and dormancy were the three most popular choices.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="process">
               <p>Using the data gathered from the survey, I compiled some user personas in order to better ideate a design that will be useful and desirable to the project's target audience.</p>
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="images/AlexO.png" alt="user persona">
                    <img src="images/DanielJ.png" alt="user persona">

              </div>
               <div class="process">
                   <p>My last step in this phase of the project was to perform a competitive analysis on current prominent plant apps. I wanted to find out what features these apps had chosen to offer, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                       <img src="images/Group68(3).png" alt="app icons">

                   </div>
                   <p>Planta was the most popular app, with an extremely in-depth onboarding process and complex paramters that influence care recommendations The visual design is a bit weak, and there is no opportunity to add friends.</p>
                   <p>Vera is another plant app with much better visual design based on a robust design system, and very pared-down features relative to Planta, with users setting schedules themselves with no recommendations given from the app. There is still no community aspect available.</p>
                   <p>Happy Plant has the simplest user interface and design out of the three, with basic reminder settings. It does offer a unique feature however, in which users can view photos of their plants in a time-lapse video.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="process">
                   <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
                   <p>At this point I felt confident enough to begin hashing out the organization and functionality of the product, which started with writing 20+ user stories based on the information gathered throughout my research. These stories were written from the point of view of the user, and organized by level of importance.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                       <p>+ As a new user I want to create an account</p>
                       <p>+ As a new user I want to add my first plant</p>
                       <p>+ As a user I want to add additional plants</p>
                       <p>+ As a user I want to view my plants</p>
                       <p>+ As a user I want to mark plants as "watered"</p>
                       <p>+ As a user I want to see when to water plants next</p>
                   </div>
               </div>
               <div class="process">
                   <p>With these tasks in mind, I was able to construct user flows to further build out the structural basis of the product. This was a crucial step that facilitated the process of creating logical and useful sketches and wireframes.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                    <img src="images/userflows2.png" alt="user flows">
                    <img src="images/userflows1.png" alt="user flows">

                </div>
                   <p>I was able to create a prototype with my wireframes through InVision, and then conduct an initial round of usability testing. Participants were asked to complete a series of tasks which included signing up for an account, as well as searching for and adding a plant. Onboarding was completed smoothly, and the other tasks were completed without too much confusion, although each user did so through different routes. It’s clear that allowing multiple pathways for singular tasks created the smoothest experience in this interface.

                   <h2>Branding & Identity</h2>
                   <p>I wanted to take the project in a different direction than the majority of the other plant apps I had studied. I wanted something a bit punchier and less feminine. After writing a word association list I chose “Potted” for the name, as I felt it encapsulated the concept I wanted to create, and tied in with the idea of houseplants, specifically.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                   <img src="images/colorlogopotted.png" alt="logo image">
                   <img src="images/logoiterationpotted.png" alt="logo iteration">
                    </div>
                   <p>The bold, rounded logo type paired with PT Mono has loads of personality, while still being harmonious. Days One as the logo type also lends itself to be part of a type-based logo, with the two “T’s” next to each other making up a pictorial pot that a simple plant can grow out of.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                   <img src="images/Typography.png" alt="typography samples">
                   </div>
                   <p>In terms of the project’s color palette, it was hard to imagine a plant-related app that strayed too far from green. To remedy this I included blue-ish and dusty-toned greens, as well as a light blue and some harmonious neturals.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                   <img src="images/Group45.png" alt="color palette one">
                   </div>
                   <p>I had planned on using the darkest green (Pantone: Slushy) as my primary brand color that would overarch the rest of the palette, but I had to change my color usage due to inadequate accessibility. This required some rearranging of the other colors’ usage and simplification of the palette, which can be seen in the high-fidelity mock-ups.</p>
                   <div class="figure">
                   <img src="images/Group46.png" alt="color palette two">
                    </div>

               <div class="process">
                   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                   <p>I do feel that the visual design turned out more feminine than I’d hoped. If I would have thought more about accessibility, I likely could have avoided this problem. I also would have liked to spend more time on illustrative elements, despite my desire to keep the app minimalistic. There are so many rich features that could have been included in this product, at times it was hard to stay away from scope creep.</p>
                   <p>However, the goal of creating a minimalistic product that still offers a variety of desired features was accomplished successfully. The project leaves plenty of room for feature expansion, as well as remains a fairly simple application to build for developers.
