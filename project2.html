               <h2>PROBLEM:</h2>
               <p> Ferino lost a main component of its income due to virus-related shutdowns, in that bars were no longer able to serve cocktails in-house. We needed a way to generate income despite this, and curbside pick-up was still an option for retail items, such as bottled cocktails.</p>
             </div>
             <div>
               <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
               <p> Revamp the online store by improving user interface design, information architecture, web copy, and product photography. Objectives also included switching to a more fitting e-commerce platform and ensuring a successful shopping and checkout experience.</p>
             </div>
           </div>



           <!-- project process -->
           <div class="process">
               <h2>UI IMPROVEMENT</h2>
               <p>Initially, Ferino hosted a Squarespace website, with a linked Weebly store, as they utilize the affiliated company Square for POS, payroll, and inventory purposes.

I began with changing certain aspects of the home page, including the addition of a hero image and a shop link button, first and foremost. </p>
               <div class="figure">
                 <div class="imgcontainer">
                 <img src="Ferino/oldhomepage.png" alt="oldhomepage">
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>I also took dozens of product photos on my iPhone, which I edited in Lightroom for display within the online store. My “photography” skills got better over time, and I eventually corrected the mistake of not creating and using presets on groups of photos, which made the process much easier. Additionally, I made the mistake of not constraining photos to the same proportions, which would have resulted in visually tidier product collection pages.</p>

                 <div class="imgcontainer">
                 <img src="Ferino/pinkpic.jpg" alt="cocktail">

               </div>
           </div>

           <div class="process">
                <h2>PLATFORM SWITCH</h2>
               <p>One of the first obstacles in the process was the lack of a seamless web store within the website. It became clear that we would benefit from a more robust e-commerce platform- one that would also offer further customization and a more robust checkout process, as well as social media integration, if possible. After discussing the pros and cons, Joe Canella, the owner and head distiller, agreed to switch to Shopify. </p>
                <div class="figure">
                  <div class="imgcontainer">
                  <img src="Ferino/oldstore.png" alt="old store page">
                </div>
                </div>
              </div>
               <div class="process">
                  <h2>PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>
                   <p>I learned after the switch that Shopify didn’t offer quite as much visual and structural customization as I had hoped for, particularly with typography, spacing, and adding additional elements to non-homepages, and learning Liquid in-depth in order to edit the code was outside the scope of the project. However, we still achieved a more visually appealing and accessible look, and better user experience than what we had started with.
                   </p>
                     <p>I was also able to brainstorm work-arounds for functional elements that we couldn’t alter completely. As one example, although Ferino does not currently offer shipping, there is no way to disable the shipping option at checkout. Our solution for this was to set a minimum weight requirement for shipping that was much higher than any of our products in order to disable shipping for all items.
                   </p>
                   <p> Additionally, there was no desire to switch from Square’s POS to Shopify’s, which brought up the issue of in-store inventory not matching up with our online store inventory. To remedy this, I was able to find a free service, SkuHarmony, that would sync the two based on SKU codes, with the click of a few buttons.
                   </p>
                   <div class="figure">

                   </div>

               <div class="process">
                    <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
                   <p>Throughout the process, I conducted user testing with the Shopify website, asking participants to both add and remove specific items from their cart, find certain information on the website while starting from the homepage, and to receive and give feedback on notifications regarding their order status.</p>

                  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                   <p>I continued to photograph, add, and track new inventory, and play a part in both the idea exploration and manufacturing of products including bottled cocktails, Ferino brand gear, and a subscription box. This project entailed a very different process than what I was used to, with less deliverables, more constraints on design, and wearing many different hats, but I learned new skills and a great deal about encountering unexpected obstacles and finding creative ways around them.</p>
